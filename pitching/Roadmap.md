## 🧭 Strategy Tips
- Don’t go broad early — start narrow (e.g., music creators, batch art).
- Be creator-centric: act more like a platform or label than just a marketplace.
- Use existing Web3 infra (Livepeer, Lens, Unlock) to save time & ship faster.
- Focus UX on simplicity, clarity, and creator empowerment.
