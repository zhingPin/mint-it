Slide Pitch Outline for GSOE — $250K Raise
Slide 1: Title / Project Name
Greatest Show On Earth (GSOE)
The future of fair, artist-first NFT marketplaces
[Your name & contact info]

Slide 2: Problem
Artists and creators are underpaid and often don’t get fair royalties.

Existing royalty systems are one-dimensional — no multi-party revenue splits.

Artists lack tools to delegate management & operations securely.

Video NFTs and rich media aren’t fully supported or easy to monetize.

Slide 3: Solution
A smart contract–enforced NFT marketplace with:
• Multi-recipient royalty splits (artists, producers, managers)
• Role-based management systems for artists (delegate hard work securely)
• Support for video NFTs & rich media
• Transparent, fair, and trustless system on Polygon

Slide 4: Product / Demo
Batch minting NFTs with custom metadata

Marketplace with listing/delisting & resale support

Dashboard for artists to manage royalty splits and delegate roles
